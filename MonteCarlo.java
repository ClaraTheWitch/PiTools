     * Summary: The Monte Carlo Method of estimating pi 
     *          works by randomly generating points within 
     *          a square with a circle inscribed. It then 
     *          gathers all the points within the circle, 
     *          divides that by the total number of points, 
     *          and then multiplies the quotient by the 
     *          area of the square. This product will be 
     *          approximately the area of the circle. Since 
     *          the formula for the area of a circle is 
     *          area = pi * radius ^ 2, one can divide the 
     *          area by the radius squared and get pi (or 
     *          an approximation in our case).
