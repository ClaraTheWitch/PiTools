# Pi Approximation Tools

This program will allow the user to simulate various methods of approximating the value of pi. When running the program, the user will be able to select a method of approximating pi, input details about the chosen simulation (the number of points for Monte Carlo method, the number of values in a series, etc) along with the number of times to run each simulation, and recieve an approximation or approximations of pi.

Details will be added as classes are created.

**MonteCarlo:** This class uses the Monte Carlo method of estimating pi. It's constructor takes the number of points to generate as a parameter. It uses a public pi() method to run the simulation and return pi.

**TestDriver:** This class is used to test the methods of other classes in the program.

## Getting Started
